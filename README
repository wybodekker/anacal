Given, for a chemical composition:
- the elemental percentages for (some of the) elements and
- a set of bruto formulae, one for each possible component
anacal calculates compositions with one or more of the formula's
resulting in a good (that is: better than a certain standard deviation) fit
between calculated and experimental element percentages.
